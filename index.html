  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    This studio didn’t start with a big plan.
    It started with learning, curiosity, and small random games. 
    Before COVID, we were just learning how to code. During COVID, Grass Studio was born not as a business, but as an attempt to create something meaningful.
    Most early games failed. None of them really took off. But we kept going.
    Years later, this studio is still here. No fixed genre. No limits. Just experiments, growth, and honest indie games. Still learning. Still building. Still trying. Never lose hope, never lose the flame.
