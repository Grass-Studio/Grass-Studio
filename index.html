  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>This studio didn’t start with a big plan. It started with learning, curiosity, and small random games. Before COVID, I was just learning how to code. During COVID, Grass Studio was born—not as a business, but as an attempt to create something meaningful.</p>
  <p>Most early games failed. None really took off. But I kept going. Years later, this studio is still here. No fixed genre. No limits. Just experiments, growth, and honest indie games. Still learning. Still building. Still trying.</p>
  <p>Never lose hope. Never lose the flame.</p>
