  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    This studio didn’t start with a big plan.
    It started with learning, curiosity, and small random games. 
    Before COVID, we were just learning how to code. During COVID, Grass Studio was born not as a business, but as an attempt to create something meaningful.
    Most early games failed. None of them really took off. But we kept going.
    Years later, this studio is still here. No fixed genre. No limits. Just experiments, growth, and honest indie games. Still learning. Still building. Still trying. Never lose hope, never lose the flame.

        Series: The Undead Nightmare, Book 0. <br>
        Before the world ended, the real nightmare had already begun. 
        Undead Nightmare: Origins follows the hidden stories of those who lived before the fall: children in shelters, survivors of storms, and scientists uncovering a terrifying truth. 
        A haunting tale of survival, secrets, and what it means to be human.
