  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    This studio didn’t start with a big plan. It started with learning, curiosity, and small random games. 
    Before COVID, I was just learning how to code. During COVID, Grass Studio was born—not as a business, 
    but as an attempt to create something meaningful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most early games failed. None really took off. But I kept going. Years later, this studio is still here. 
    No fixed genre. No limits. Just experiments, growth, and honest indie games. Still learning. Still building. 
    Still trying.
  </p>
  <p>
    Never lose hope. Never lose the flame.

      <h3>Mountain Tales</h3>
      <p>
        Mountain Tales is an adventure game set in a vast world of towering mountains and wide plateaus, where harsh nature meets deep tranquility. 
        The journey begins in a small, simple village, whose people live surrounded by ancient legends and old tales passed down through generations—stories of heroes, mysterious creatures, and hidden forces dwelling in the high peaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player embarks on mythical adventures focused on exploration, uncovering secrets, and facing challenges inspired by folklore and epic fantasy. 
        Every mountain tells a story, every plateau hides a mystery, and as the journey progresses, deep connections between the village and the surrounding world are gradually revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game emphasizes atmosphere, storytelling, and the feeling of a slow, meaningful journey. Adventure is not just about combat, but about discovery, reflection, and living within a world rich with lore, choices, and consequences. Mountain Tales is not just a game—it is a story experienced step by step among the peaks.

      <h3>Heartfall</h3>
      <p>
        Hony Life is a true open-world fantasy exploration game where the story is optional and freedom comes first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wander a petrified world shaped by a shattered crystal, uncover hidden locations, forgotten creatures, and mysteries at your own pace — or ignore the narrative entirely and simply explore.
